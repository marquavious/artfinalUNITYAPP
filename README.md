# artfinalUNITYBUILD
A game I made for an art final. It is an environment where you just walk around and look around. Eventually, I want to make a 1000x better version with more/better elements and have it connected to Oculus Rift :) I made the Graphics (w/PhotoShop), And I made the music using Ableton Live. Altho a pretty basic app, it was really fun making this and I can't wait to make better games in the future.

The APK is for android phones
The .exe is for computer play
