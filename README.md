A game I made for an art final. It is an environment where you just walk around and look around. Eventually, I want to make a 1000x better version with more/better elements and have it connected to Oculus Rift :) I made the Graphics (w/PhotoShop), And I made the music using Ableton Live. Altho a pretty basic app, it was really fun making this and I can't wait to make better games in the future.

(Must have the _data file to play the game)

(I might this on the app store for the heck of it. I let you know here when it's up, although it's nothing spectacular. I promise there will be better games and apps to come!!)
